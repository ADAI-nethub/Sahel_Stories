Each time a visitor listens to a story from a local artisan, a tree is planted via a reforestation partner.

Built as a beginner-friendly, ethical tech project aligned with the Great Green Wall Initiative.

## Local Development




🧭 Purpose
To preserve oral traditions of the Sahel while driving real climate action by linking cultural storytelling to verified tree planting — empowering local artisans and engaging global travelers in a meaningful way.

🌱 Cause
To support the Great Green Wall Initiative by creating a human-centered digital bridge between cultural heritage and environmental restoration — where every story heard helps grow the green belt of Africa.

🕊️ Belief
We believe that stories are seeds. When shared with care, they can grow forests, revive traditions, and connect people across continents — not through gamification, but through genuine respect and reciprocity.


🎯 Executive Summary
The idea you decided to work on.

Sahel Stories is a Django web application that centers local voices from the Sahel region by digitizing oral stories about drought, trees, traditions, and survival — and turning each "listen" into a real tree planted via a verified reforestation partner.
