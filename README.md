# Sahel_Stories
"A Django app that plants trees when cultural stories are heard – for the Sahel &amp; Great Green Wall"
🌍 Capstone Project Development Document
Title: Sahel Stories – A Cultural & Climate Connection Platform
🧭 Purpose
To preserve oral traditions of the Sahel while driving real climate action by linking cultural storytelling to verified tree planting — empowering local artisans and engaging global travelers in a meaningful way.

🌱 Cause
To support the Great Green Wall Initiative by creating a human-centered digital bridge between cultural heritage and environmental restoration — where every story heard helps grow the green belt of Africa.

🕊️ Belief
We believe that stories are seeds. When shared with care, they can grow forests, revive traditions, and connect people across continents — not through gamification, but through genuine respect and reciprocity.

✅ Project Title: Sahel Stories
Goal:
A beginner-friendly Django web app that allows local artisans to share cultural stories tied to climate resilience, and triggers real tree planting when a story is listened to by a visitor.

This project serves as the first step toward a larger vision of art-and-climate-driven tourism — starting small, with dignity, impact, and sustainability at its core.

🎯 Executive Summary
The idea you decided to work on.

Sahel Stories is a Django web application that centers local voices from the Sahel region by digitizing oral stories about drought, trees, traditions, and survival — and turning each "listen" into a real tree planted via a verified reforestation partner.

Built with simplicity and empathy, this project:

Lets artisans share their stories (audio + text)
Lets visitors listen and contribute to reforestation
Logs each tree planted with location and story link
Uses Django Admin for easy content management
Is designed to scale into SMS/WhatsApp access later
It is not a full tourism platform — it’s a focused, ethical, and beginner-accessible step toward one.

✅ What This Project Covers:
What features your project will have.

Artisan profiles (local storytellers)
Story listings with location and transcript
“Listen & Plant” action (simulated or real tree planting)
Tree planting tracker (with visitor name & date)
Admin interface for managing content
Simple HTML frontend (Django templates)


🎯 Core Purpose
This web app supports cultural preservation and climate action by allowing:

Artisans to share stories of resilience and tradition.
Visitors to listen and trigger tree planting.
NGOs to manage content via Django Admin.
The planet to benefit from verified reforestation.
